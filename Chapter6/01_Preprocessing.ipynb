    "# PPSIM Toolbox Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "PPSIM provides a general interface for specifying the structure of the data of interest, a dynamical model to fit to the data, and for building data-processing pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires the presence of the following `*.yml`-files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `specifications.yml` the main file for setting up the data processing, including locaton of the data, regular expressions for data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model.yml`, a file specifying the mathematical model, model states and data bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stream.yml`, a placeholder file for specifying the pipleine (not yet working)\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at each in detail to see what they contain.\n",
    "PPSIM generates an object that enables easy access to attributes and setings used in the construction of pipelines.\n",
    "The specifications-file allows for external resources, such as custom code to be included in the processing.\n",
    "At the moment, the pipeline-feature is deprecated, `script.jl` describes the pipeline in pure julia code.\n",
    "To process the data, simply modify the `specifications.yml`-file to point to the right data-source, specify an appropriate path for the folder to hold the processed data, and run `scrip.jl`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Specification-File\n",
    "`specifications.yml` the main file for setting up the data processing.\n",
    "Here, we specify:\n",
    "- where our data sits (`source`, `sink`)\n",
    "- what we expect headers of the MaxQuant-table to look like (`headerpattern`)\n",
    "- how different sample types are distinguished (`sampletypes`)\n",
    "- which conditions we look for (`conditions`)\n",
    "- how crossmixes between different conditions are named (`crossmixes`)\n",
    "- how the different experiments are identified (`experiment_ids`)\n",
    "- how timepoints are specified in the headers (`timepoints -> hdr`)\n",
    "- ...and what their numerical value is (`timepoints -> values`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we define a set of functions to extract timecourse-data and errors calculated by MaxQuant from the table,  (`timecourses`, `errors`), we define colours associated with the conditions in our plots (`colors`), and list a set of files, that serve as customised extensions to the general codebase of the toolbox (`include`).\n",
